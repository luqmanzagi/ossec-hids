	Decoders filename attribute
		PR #915 - A few fixes, but most importantly the ability to set the filename attribute from a decoder. This will help create automated pipelines for FIM Verification. I currently need to compare FIM events against 1) Puppet, 2) GIT, and 3) RPM. This patch allows FIM events to be intercepted by my custom FIM Verification script, which generates logging events which OSSEC can read and turn back into an event with the filename attribute set.
